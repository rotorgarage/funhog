## Commercial Use

The owners of this code maintain perpetual ability to license, sell, and profit from this work, including any derivatives, regardless of origin.

### Arbitration

Regarding conflict of interest between Open Source and Commercial licenses.  In the event that an open source branch has features desired for the `master` branch (including commercial) the decision is made to:

* First attempt to contact the committer and gain permission to incorporate changes into `master` (including commercial) branch of the source repository.
* Provide credit in the `master` (including commercial) source.
* If necessary we will incorporate new features via a legal air-gap, technically reverse engineering a derivative product.

### License Background

Multiple times we have had a major player in the drone business steal open source designs and refuse to even provide legally required attribution.  For example, DJI used [Maarten Baert](https://www.maartenbaert.be/quadcopters/antennas/pagoda-antenna/)'s designs [without](https://store.dji.com/product/dji-goggles-racing-edition-pagoda-antenna-sma-interface) any attribution. 

The files are here for you to use, modify, and most importantly fly. We stock key parts on the [Fun Hog](https://finhog.me) site.  We don't want to give up the ability to trade, barter, bargain, trade, or possibly sell licenses to this work.  Collaborators and partners always welcome.
